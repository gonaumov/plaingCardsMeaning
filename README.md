# Simple interface shows which is your card according to your birth date.

I have something like a hobby to made plaing cards reading. 
I saw a few places a similar app already implemented, but I did not like how they were made. 
I think to do something similar with ReactJS and ReactJS router. 
But I must first have all the cards and according images into json file so I write this 
little scrapper. I share this scrapper and data for people that want to implement 
similar application in the future.
