      "The Joker is a mysterious Card, and they are a mysterious people born on the day of the Joker!",
      "Identified as \"all things to all men\", this most compelling and ambiguous Card is known as the chameleon; their disguises are many, and varied. They have an enormous amount of personal power at their disposal, but knowing how to apply it in life is quite another thing....",
      "The Joker also has a dark side. They can become obsessive, cunning, and selfish. They are masters of disguise and will conceal their dubious characteristics with deft ambiguity. Like a pendulum, the Joker can swing as far into the virtues of noble strength as they can swing deep into the well of petty selfishness. It is only through the practical application of their inherent  powers that the Joker is able rise above the dark side, to which they are equally familiar.",
      "All Jokers are wonderfully unique, a mysterious people who have the capacity for great wisdom. It is nearly impossible to analyze them as they hold the key to themselves and guard it well!",
      "The Joker is very passionate in both likes and dislikes. These extremes can be a source of discontent in their relationships, but when they feel they are secure in love, they are one of the most affectionate and creative of lovers!"

      "\"If you were born on the first day of the year, the top card in the deck, the King of Spades is your personal symbol. It represents the ultimate in spiritual energy and wisdom. Perhaps recognition of this tremendous potential, and directing these forces into some constructive expression will be the greatest challenge of all. This is not likely to be helped by the fact that this power, spectacular as it can be, is apt to be of such a subtle, spiritual nature, that you may not even recognize it, or feel sufficiently motivated to develop it.",

Rise to the challenge, and you may bring inspired leadership as a teacher, counselor, healer, statesman or parent. Accept the opportunity spelled out symbolically in your card, and apply the essence of mastery, or personal discipline which it encompasses, and there should be no limit to what you can accomplish.\"\n        – Arne Lein - \"What's Your Card?\""

      "All Six of Club feel an obligation toward duty and they take their responsibilities seriously. Trouble is, the 6 of Club also symbolize inertia and easygoing lethargy. Hence many people born with Six of Club karma find it difficult to gain enough momentum to get up to speed and fulfill their lofty dreams. On the plus side, when a Six of Club does manage to overcome this karma, they have the unique ability to stay with a project, circumstance, or relationship until all obstacles are overcome.",

But unless the 8's of Heart manage to find their true  love, they have a bad habit of racing through many loves, leaving a trail of broken hearts in their wake.",

Then there are those 8 of Heart who apply themselves to big business and end up being wildly successful in large organizations.",
      "To make the best of their life pattern, all 8 of Heart need to be in the drivers seat - while at the same time - being careful not to bully others with their intense emotional power. So relax! And realize you are loved."

However, when it comes to love, they are only interested in meaningful or long term relationships. Mental rapport is high on their list requirements, and their straightforward charm and forthright demeanor almost always get them where they want to go."
